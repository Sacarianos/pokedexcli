# **Pokedex CLI in Go** üêæ

Welcome to the **Pokedex CLI** project! This command-line application, written in **Golang**, is a tool to explore Pok√©mon data in an interactive and efficient way. It‚Äôs not just about catching ‚Äòem all‚Äîit‚Äôs about learning Golang concepts like HTTP requests, REPLs, caching, and more while building something fun and useful!

## **Features**

- **Browse map locations**  
  Browse over 1000 locations in the pokemon world.
  
- **Interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**  
  Engage with the Pokedex in an interactive shell environment.

- **Caching**  
  Speed up subsequent searches by caching results locally.

- **HTTP Integration**  
  Fetch live Pok√©mon data from a public API.

- **Custom Commands**  
  Use specialized commands for advanced queries or help options.

## **Goals**

By the end of this project, you will:

1. Understand and make **HTTP requests** in Go.
2. Implement a **REPL interface**.
3. Learn how to **cache API responses**.
4. Enhance your understanding of Go's **standard library**.
5. Build a fully functional command-line tool.
